#### Development of Fire Index Ratio (Mine Fire) Software <br>
#### <i> CSIR-Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (Jan 2004-June 2004) </i> 
Coal fire exists in many coal-bearing countries like the USA, South Africa, Venezuela, China, and India. Jharia Coal Mine (JCF), India has the largest prime coking coal resource in the world; however, these are endangered by the coal fires.

Different toxic and non-toxic fire gases are liberated due to the oxidation of coal in sealed-off coal mines. Monitoring of fire gases is mandatory for the determination of fire status. For that reason, different fire indices are determined to examine the extent of the fire. The indices are calculated by programming in Visual Basic 6.0 and stored in the Oracle 8i database. Further various graphs were generated to determine the fire status.<br>

#### Vulnerability assessment of Dhanbad district using Remote Sensing and GIS and development of Information System (Predictor) using COM programming  <br>
#### <i> Department of Remote Sensing, BIT Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India (Jan 2009-June 2009) </i>
The main objective of this project is to process the different hazards in the Dhanbad district viz. Land Degradation, Mine Fire, Air Pollution, and Water Pollution, and to prepare a vulnerability zonation map of the whole district to predict which hazard is most dangerous for the residents. A small software module Predictor is developed to perform the analysis using Visual Basic as the front end and Oracle 8i as the back end. <br>

#### Design & Development of River Water Quality Management (RQM) Information System Using Data Visualization Techniques for River Stretches Blending with Multi-Industrial Effluents <br>

#### <i> Department of Computer Application, Vinoba Bhave University, Hazaribagh, Jharkhand, India (Jun 2013-Feb 2014) </i>
The River Quality Management is an information system developed to measure the current pollution level in a river stretch blended with multi-industrial outfall, analyze the situation, and take suitable measures to control the pollution level of the river stretch. The system takes into account various conservative as well as non-conservative pollution parameters and obtains the concentration of such parameters along the river stretch. For the same, the system incorporates various mathematical models for the computation of velocity variation along the river stretch, flow rate computation, and cross-sectional area computation. The system finally uses a three-dimensional water quality model to compute the concentration of vivid pollutants at various points in the river stretch to predict the quality of the river. The system uses Data Visualization techniques to plot graphs and analyze the current scenario of water pollution.

####  Feature Extraction and Classified Mapping in a specific Urban Area of KMC (Kolkata Municipal Corporation) using Geospatial techniques.

#### <i> Computer-Aided Design Centre, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. (Aug 2018-Jan 2019) </i>

The major objective of this project is to extract, classify, and map vegetation and urban features from ward number 19 and 20 of Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) urban area. After extraction of the features, the outcomes are statistically analyzed and the results are compared ward-wise.

For the same high resolution rectified, satellite data is used to generate a False Natural Color Composite (FNCC) image and is then fused with PAN data. This fused image is used to vectorize ward boundaries and roads. The multispectral data is classified twice. In the first case, NDVI of the multispectral data is generated and then it is reclassified. This is used to extract the vegetation canopy. In the next case, the multispectral data is used for single-class classification to extract urban features. 

From the secondary data, the Ms-Access database is created through manual input. Next, the geodatabase is created to include the spatially extracted data along with non-spatial data being joined from the Ms-Access database.

Finally, the statistics are generated from the extracted data, and charts are prepared along with map layouts.
