### Projects Completed 
#### Development of Fire Index Ratio (Mine Fire) Software <br>
Different toxic and non-toxic fire gases are liberated due to the oxidation of coal in sealed-off coal mines. Monitoring of fire gases is mandatory for the determination of fire status. For that reason, different fire indices are determined for examining the extent of the fire. The indices were calculated by programming in Visual Basic and stored in the Oracle 8i database. Further various graphs were generated to determine the fire status.<br>
#### Vulnerability assessment of Dhanbad district using Remote Sensing and GIS and development of Information System (Predictor) using COM programming  <br>
The main objective of this project is to process the different hazards in the Dhanbad district viz. Land Degradation, Mine Fire, Air Pollution, and Water Pollution, and to prepare a vulnerability zonation map of the whole district to predict which hazard is most dangerous for the residents. A small software module Predictor is developed to perform the analysis using Visual Basic as the front end and Oracle 8i as the back end. <br>
#### Design & Development of River Water Quality Management (RQM) Information System Using Data Visualization Techniques for River Stretches Blending with Multi-Industrial Effluents <br>
The River Quality Management is an information system developed to measure the current pollution level in a river stretch blended with multi-industrial outfall, analyze the situation, and take suitable measures to control the pollution level of the river stretch. The system takes into account various conservative as well as non-conservative pollution parameters and obtains the concentration of such parameters along the river stretch. For the same, the system incorporates various mathematical models for the computation of velocity variation along the river stretch, flow rate computation, and cross-sectional area computation. The system finally uses a three-dimensional water quality model to compute the concentration of vivid pollutants at various points in the river stretch to predict the quality of the river. The system uses Data Visualization techniques to plot graphs and analyze the current scenario of water pollution.
